        <p>Tables. Tables in essence are grids. First tags are table (table) and row. Within the tr tag, have either table heading row (th) or table data row (td). Tables also have columns.<br/>
        Separate th elements within the same tr in essence create the number of columns.<br/>
        Do NOT need to put on separate lines in code, but can for ease of human reading the code.<br/>
        Can put a border attribute in the table tag (NOT recommended); use CSS instead.<br/>
        The <strong>rowspan</strong> tag goes in the first (highest) <strong>td </strong> tag to be combined into one table unit.
        <br/>
        The <strong>colspan</strong> tag goes in the left-most<strong> td </strong> tag to be combined into one tag.
