        <h1>Some Remodel Samples</h1>
        <p>Images need to be in the same folder or in a subfolder of the same folder where the html file is. The image tag is like the break tag, closed with a slash at the end of the opening tag, no separate closing tag. Besides the source (src) attribute, also need an alt attribute, which is a text description of the image (provides an alternative if the link is broken; used by readers; also important for Google indexing).</p>
        <p>Just like any other element, image elements are accessible via CSS in html5.</p>
